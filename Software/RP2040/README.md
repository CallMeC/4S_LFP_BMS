# Embedded Software
Here is the software of the BMS running on the RP2040 microcontroler.

The current version of firmware availiable is the foundation for the future firmware.
It currently allows to use different peripherals (I2C, external ADCs, GPIOs, ...) as well as saving values to Flash.
It also constantly streams random (but coherent) values on the UART (through USB) which can be read by the GUI Computer software.

Description and documentation of the software will come soon, it is still under developpement.
